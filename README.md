# Material Time Control

A simple time picker component using angular/material2 (5.0.0-rc0).<br/>
While this component only shows a 12 hour clock it can easily be extended to show 12/24 mode.<br/>
The main focus here a button beside a normal textbox that opens a dialog to select your hour, minute and meridan.
<br/><br/>
I didn't focus on any responsive layouts as the only place I needed this was desktop but since it leverages flex throughout, it could be modified to change orientation in portrait phone mode.
<br/><br/>
